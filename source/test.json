I've worked with Jen while at two organizations and was never disappointed with the results she produced. Jen's a dream designer; she takes an idea and turns it into a fully-baked concept, her work is original and eye-catching, and her turnaround time is fast; not to mention, Jen's a true pleasure to work with. One of my favorite aspects about Jen's work is that she was able to produce fun, but professional designs--we were able to escape the corporate/stuffy feel with Jen's expertise and help. -- Callie Jones, Marketing Manager, Perficient</i>"],
